 * This should become a full-fledged class for manipulating the entire data structure / file.
 * It is a bit complicated since the in-memory file system used by yeoman does not have
 * the same interface as 'fs'.
 * Either way, the file system would need to be injected.
 *
 * This class should be shared across any modules/plugins that need to deal with this file.
 * configApi.js in force-com-toolbelt has similar functions plus others related to overall
 * configuration, but would need to be modified to fit the needs here.
